Chow Catch is a simple game, I made while learning Kaboom.js.
Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to make games fast. -> https://kaboomjs.com/

(Beware Volume Level)
Play Here -> https://motbcs.github.io/ChowCatch.github.io/
<br>
Controls : Use arrow keys to move hand to catch falling food. If the dog catches more than three food items it's game over.
